### Hi there 👋


**My Name's Nick, and this is my stuff 


- 🔭 I’m currently working on multiple Website Projects, for example https://Emmersis.com , and on my own game!
- 🌱 I always wanted to learn Python, and then I learned HTML/CSS/JS... But it's more fun anyway! (I'm learning python _now_)
- 🤔 I want to start a youtube channel for uploading devlogs sometime but I just don't know where to start
- 💬 Ask me about anything really. I love talking to new people!
- 📫 Wanna talk? https://discord.gg/hrnvkRcD5B
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him, but if you want to use anything else sure! I don't really care
